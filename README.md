# About
Adds extra options for character creation in Baldur's Gate 3.

## Acknowledgements
Tacolicious and Brekkie, from DbtR, were the inspirations for this mod. <3

I would not have known that the "NonSkinColor" parameter changed horn's colour if not for [KittenTails](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/53284786) mod [Misc mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/226).

I used the template provided by [Padme4000](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/2651530) in her mod [Padme's Extra Colours for Character Creation](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/115) to make this.

Thank you [HoneyWhite](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/43502557) for the tip about the "NonSkinTipColor" parameter!
